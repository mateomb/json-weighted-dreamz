Weighted Dreamz is a web page that reads from a JSON file in order to display data on the web page, 
more specificly which image to display when the user selects what kind of blanket they are interested in.
The web page was made using a template as the primary goal was the creation of the form which is found at the end of the page.
The page allows the user to select from 3 different drop downs each of which has a blanket type,pattern and color tied to the selection.
